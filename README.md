## Installation

```sh
npm install --save react-cursor-position
```

## Usage

Intended as a primitive for composing features that require notification of
mouse cursor position status.

```JSX
import ReactCursorPosition from 'react-cursor-position';
...

<ReactCursorPosition>
    <YourComponentOne/>
    <YourComponentTwo/>
</ReactCursorPosition>
```
ReactCursorPosition wraps its children in a div, which mouse cursor position
is plotted relative to.

Each child component will receive a prop named `cursorPosition`, which
has the following structure.

```JavaScript
{
    x: Number,
    y: Number,
    isOutside: Boolean
}
```
